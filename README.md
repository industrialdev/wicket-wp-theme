# Wicket WordPress Theme

## Dev Environment Setup Notes
* Clone repo
* Run `yarn` to install node dependencies
* Run `yarn gulp` (or just `gulp` if you have it installed globally on your system) to freshly build the scripts and styles, and kickoff the 'watch' command while you make frontend file changes

### Requirements

- WSL2 on Windows, or Linux/macOS with Bash 5.x or greater (ZSH is also compatible). On macOS, ensure Bash is up to date, even if you're using ZSH. Use [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/bash) to update Bash if needed.
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) installed in your code editor.
- (Optional) [PHP CS Fixer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=junstyle.php-cs-fixer) extension for VSCode, or the equivalent for your editor of choice (e.g., [Sublime Text](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/PHP%20CS%20Fixer)). Having this extension installed allows PHP-CS-Fixer to run on file save, so your code is formatted automatically without needing to wait for a git commit to trigger the formatting.

You can run the command `composer vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix` from the root of the repository (or `docker compose exec php sh -c "cd /var/www/html/web/app/themes/wicket-wp-theme && vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix"` if the theme is used from the baseline in a docker container) to run PHP-CS-Fixer with the embedded PHP binary.

## Developer Helpers:
* Add `?bootstrap` to your URL to temporarily enqueue Bootstrap via CDN for purposes of migrating from legacy Bootstrap styles
* Add `?breakpoints` to your URL to show what Tailwind breakpoint you're currently viewing with an indicator in the bottom-right corner
* In your PHP code, you can use `wicket_write_log ( $message )` to print anything to the debug.log, including arrays, objects, and strings. Helpful if you don't want to print_r things to the screen wrapped in `<pre>` tags, _but_ you can also use `write_log ( $message, true )` to do just that with less code ðŸ™‚
  * Note that we had to add "wicket_" to the front of the function name because other plugins sometimes use a simpler version of "write_log" for their own debugging purposes
* "Deprecated" and "Notice" error logs have been hidden via an mu-plugin
* `wicket_generate_structured_menu( $wp_nav_items_array )` accepts an array of WP nav items (grabbed from a function like `wp_get_nav_menu_items()`, for example), and returns a structured associative array of menu items, with child items nested in the array (currently up to 3 levels). It also calculates the number of children and grandchildren items below each item and saves them in the array, making menu rendering much easier and requiring less looping in the template.
* Add `?colours` to your URL to show all colours available to Tailwind that were generated from the `theme.json` file. 
  * If the names or varieties of the colours are changed in either `theme.json` or `tailwind.config.js`, you can use `?generate_colours_array` and the looping function in `header.php` to generate a new array of colours to place inside the `?colours` conditional inside `header.php`.
  * If this ever needs to be removed to make the CSS file _slightly_ smaller (as it doesn't generate that much CSS), a find/replace could be done to replace "bg-" with something like "bghide-" in that block of code, which would make Tailwind ignore it at build time.
